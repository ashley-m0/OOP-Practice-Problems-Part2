Exercise 41 - Name Sorter
Alphabetizing the contents of a file, or sorting its contents, is a great way to get comfortable
manipulating a file in your program.

Create a program that reads in the following list of names from a file called `exercise41_input.txt`
and sorts the list alphabetically:
Ling, Mai
Johnson, Jim
Zarnecki, Sabrina
Jones, Chris
Jones, Aaron
Swift, Geoffrey
Xiong, Fong

Then print the sorted list to a file called `exercise41_output.txt` that looks like the following
example output.

Example Output:
Total of 7 names
-----------------
Johnson, Jim
Jones, Aaron
Jones, Chris
Ling, Mai
Swift, Geoffrey
Xiong, Fong
Zarnecki, Sabrina

Constraint:
Don't hard-code the number of names.

Challenges:
Implement this program by reading in the names from the user, one at a time, and printing out the
sorted results to a file.
Use the program to sort data from a large data set (e.g. census data) and use a profiler to analyze
its performance.
